            <h3 class="belief-title">Belief 1: Intrinsic Value</h3>
            <p class="belief-text">We believe a stock's worth is best determined by the underlying business's long-term economics, not by what others are willing to pay in the short-term.</p>

            <h3 class="belief-title">Belief 2: Novel Paradoxical Insight</h3>
            <p class="belief-text">We believe that by generating novel paradoxes that humanity has not yet seen, one can create immense new markets for investors, shareholders, and society. More significantly, by generating certain sequences of paradoxes, one can connect seemingly disparate ideas to generate novel paradoxical insights. These insights are the basis for identifying our high conviction themes and companies we find attractive.</p>

            <h3 class="belief-title">Belief 3: Machine Learning and Human Psychology</h3>
            <p class="belief-text">We believe in applying data science techniques and ideas from machine learning to validate our investment theses and trade ideas before execution. In addition to our fundamental and quantitative approach to stock selection, we apply a deep understanding of human psychology during our investment analysis and trade execution.</p>

          <article class="belief-card">
            <h3 class="belief-title">Belief 4: Rational and Disciplined Execution</h3>
            <p class="belief-text">We believe the market misprices securities for behavioral reasons. These arise due to market participants reacting to developments emotionally, rather than rationally, and to some market participants' misaligned incentives. By remaining rational and disciplined in managing our portfolio, we can take advantage of the market's mistakes while guarding against mistakes of our own.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="belief-card">
            <h3 class="belief-title">Belief 5: Concentrated Portfolio</h3>
            <p class="belief-text">We believe in concentration over diversification. After constructing a portfolio of high conviction stocks where being wrong on any single judgment should not result in a material loss of principal for the portfolio as a whole, additional diversification is more likely to increase, rather than reduce, risk by forcing the inclusion of increasingly inferior investments.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Our Philanthropic Mission</h2>
          <p class="philanthropy-text">At Daisy Capital Partners, we believe that success is measured not only by financial returns, but by the positive impact we create in the world. We are committed to dedicating 10% of all profits to the Daisy Foundation, which advances two critical missions close to our hearts.</p>
          
          <p class="philanthropy-text">The Daisy Foundation provides funding for <strong>Daisy Sanctuary</strong>, a meditative retreat on the Santa Barbara coast for those struggling with mental illness and seeking an alternative treatment modality based on Eastern philosophy. This sanctuary offers a peaceful haven where individuals can find healing through contemplative practices and holistic care. Daisy Sanctuary is dedicated in honor of the founder's most loving and sweet goldendoodle named Daisy.</p>
          
          <p class="philanthropy-text">Additionally, the Foundation supports <strong>Daisy Education</strong>, whose mission is to provide educational funding for extremely poor children in emerging countries like South Vietnam. Our first funding initiative supports children in Canh Tho, Vietnam, where our founder was born. We believe that education is the most powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty and creating lasting generational change.</p>
          
          <p class="philanthropy-text">Through these initiatives, we aim to foster both mental wellness and educational opportunity for initiatives that have deeply impacted the founder's own life. While appearing callous on the surface, the founder recognizes that there is really no purpose in life, no one in bondage or suffering, no one desirous of liberation, and thus, there is no one to be liberated.</p>
